                    Christian Education is a transformative force that impacts the home, church, school, and society. Its main mission is teaching, discipleship, and equipping individuals to become more like Christ. Defined as a Bible-based, Holy Spirit-led process, Christian Education aims to guide people through their spiritual growth, using modern teaching methods. Its goal is to help individuals understand and experience God's purpose through Christ in every aspect of life, while preparing them for effective ministry. The focus is on Christ’s example as the Master Educator and His command to make disciples, supporting individuals through life’s transitions from birth to death.
